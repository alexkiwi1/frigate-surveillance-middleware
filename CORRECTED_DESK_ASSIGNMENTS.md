## ðŸŽ¯ **System Logic (Updated)**

### **Step 1: Desk-Based Assignment (Primary)**
- **Phone violation** at `desk_47` â†’ **Tahir Ahmed**
- **Phone violation** at `desk_6` â†’ **Arifa Khatoon**
- **Phone violation** at `desk_13` â†’ **Nabeel Bhatti**

### **Step 2: Face Recognition Verification (Secondary)**
- **If face recognition matches desk assignment**: Use face confidence
- **If face recognition differs**: Use desk assignment (higher priority)
- **If no face recognition**: Use desk assignment

### **Step 3: Fallback (Last Resort)**
- **If no desk assignment**: Use face recognition
- **If no face recognition**: Return "Unknown"

## âœ… **Test Results (Corrected System)**

```json
{
  "zones": "[\"employee_area\", \"desk_13\"]",
  "employee_name": "Nabeel Bhatti",    // âœ… Correct official assignment
  "confidence": 0.95                   // âœ… High confidence
}
```

```json
{
  "zones": "[\"employee_area\", \"desk_19\"]", 
  "employee_name": "Sameer Panhwar",   // âœ… Correct official assignment
  "confidence": 0.95                   // âœ… High confidence
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Benefits of Corrected System**

1. **Official Assignments**: Uses your provided official desk list
2. **Accurate Names**: All employee names match official assignments
3. **Surname Updates**: Handles name changes (Arifa Dhari â†’ Arifa Khatoon)
4. **Desk Priority**: Desk assignments take priority over face recognition
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 60 desks properly mapped

## ðŸš€ **System Status: FULLY CORRECTED**

The violation system now uses the correct official desk assignments and will properly identify employees based on their assigned desks! ðŸŽ‰
