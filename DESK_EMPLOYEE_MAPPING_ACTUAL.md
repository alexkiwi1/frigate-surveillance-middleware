# 🎯 Actual Desk-Employee Mapping (Based on Real Detections)

## 📊 **Updated Status of "Missing" Employee Desks**

### ✅ **Desks with People (5 desks) - Need Name Mapping**

| Desk | Your List | Most Frequent Employee | Detection Count | Status |
|------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Desk 12** | Awais Sheikh | **Muhammad Taha** (16 detections) | 205 total | ✅ **Occupied by Muhammad Taha** |
| **Desk 19** | Sameer Panhwar | **Muhammad Tabish** (17 detections) | 130 total | ✅ **Occupied by Muhammad Tabish** |
| **Desk 27** | Bhamar Lal | **Ali Habib** (8 detections) | 87 total | ✅ **Occupied by Ali Habib** |
| **Desk 38** | Kabeer Qadir | **Abdul Kabeer** (14 detections) | 111 total | ✅ **Occupied by Abdul Kabeer** |
| **Desk 41** | Zaib Ali Mughal | **Unknown** (2 detections) | 2 total | ⚠️ **Very few detections** |

### ❌ **Desks with No Detections (3 desks) - Truly Vacant**

| Desk | Your List | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Desk 3** | Aiman Jawaid | ❌ **No detections - Truly vacant** |
| **Desk 1** | Safia Imtiaz | ❌ **No detections - Truly vacant** |
| **Desk 25** | Mehmood Memon | ❌ **No detections - Truly vacant** |

## 🎯 **Corrected Desk Assignments**

### **Desks with Multiple People (Shared Desks)**
These desks have multiple people detected, suggesting they might be shared or people move between desks:

#### **Desk 12** - Multiple People Detected
- **Muhammad Taha** (16 detections) - Primary occupant
- **Muhammad Awais** (15 detections) - Secondary occupant
- **Khalid Ahmed** (7 detections)
- **Nimra Fareed** (5 detections)
- **Syed Safwan Ali Hashmi** (5 detections)
- And 7 others with fewer detections

#### **Desk 19** - Multiple People Detected  
- **Muhammad Tabish** (17 detections) - Primary occupant
- **Bilal Soomro** (14 detections) - Secondary occupant
- **Sufiyan Ahmed** (8 detections)
- **Muhammad Arsalan** (5 detections)
- **Muhammad Qasim** (5 detections)
- And 10 others with fewer detections

#### **Desk 27** - Multiple People Detected
- **Ali Habib** (8 detections) - Primary occupant
- **Atban Bin Aslam** (6 detections) - Secondary occupant
- **Muhammad Tabish** (4 detections)
- **Sumair Hussain** (2 detections)
- **Bilal Soomro** (2 detections)
- And 3 others with fewer detections

#### **Desk 38** - Multiple People Detected
- **Abdul Kabeer** (14 detections) - Primary occupant
- **Muhammad Tabish** (13 detections) - Secondary occupant
- **Abdul Wassay** (12 detections)
- **Aashir Ali** (5 detections)
- **Arbaz** (4 detections)
- And 10 others with fewer detections

## 🔧 **Recommended Desk Assignments**

Based on the most frequent detections:

```javascript
const actualDeskAssignments = {
  // Primary occupants (most frequent detections)
  12: "Muhammad Taha",        // 16 detections (was "Awais Sheikh")
  19: "Muhammad Tabish",      // 17 detections (was "Sameer Panhwar") 
  27: "Ali Habib",           // 8 detections (was "Bhamar Lal")
  38: "Abdul Kabeer",        // 14 detections (was "Kabeer Qadir")
  41: "Unknown",             // Only 2 detections (was "Zaib Ali Mughal")
  
  // Truly vacant desks
  3: null,                   // No detections (was "Aiman Jawaid")
  1: null,                   // No detections (was "Safia Imtiaz")
  25: null,                  // No detections (was "Mehmood Memon")
  
  // All other desks remain the same...
};
```

## 📊 **Updated Summary**

| Status | Count | Percentage | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|
| ✅ **Perfect Match** | 32 | 53.3% | Exact name matches |
| ✅ **Name Variations** | 15 | 25.0% | Database has correct names |
| ✅ **Occupied by Different Person** | 5 | 8.3% | Desks have people, but different names |
| ❌ **Truly Vacant** | 8 | 13.3% | 3 no detections + 5 originally vacant |
| **Total** | 60 | 100% | |

## 🎯 **Key Findings**

1. **5 "missing" employees are actually there** - but with different names or shared desks
2. **3 desks are truly vacant** - no detections at all
3. **Some desks are shared** - multiple people detected at same desk
4. **Desk assignments need updating** - based on actual occupancy

## 🔧 **Action Items**

1. **Update desk assignments** to match actual occupants
2. **Investigate shared desks** - are they really shared or people moving around?
3. **Add face recognition** for the 3 truly vacant desks if people should be there
4. **Use primary occupants** for desk-based violation linking

**Result: 52 out of 60 desks (86.7%) have actual people detected!** 🎉
