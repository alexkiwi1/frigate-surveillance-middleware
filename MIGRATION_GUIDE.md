# Migration Guide for FastAPI Best Practices

## Automated Migration Completed

The following files have been automatically migrated:
- app/routers/violations.py
- app/routers/employees.py  
- app/routers/cameras.py

## Manual Migration Steps Required

### 1. Update Main Application
Replace the current main.py with main_improved.py:
```bash
cp app/main_improved.py app/main.py
```

### 2. Update Configuration
Replace the current config.py with config_improved.py:
```bash
cp app/config_improved.py app/config.py
```

### 3. Update Dependencies
Replace the current dependencies.py with dependencies_improved.py:
```bash
cp app/dependencies_improved.py app/dependencies.py
```

### 4. Update Response Formatting
Replace the current formatting.py with response_formatter.py:
```bash
cp app/utils/response_formatter.py app/utils/formatting.py
```

### 5. Test the Migration
Run the test suite to ensure everything works:
```bash
python3 test_api.py
```

### 6. Update Docker Configuration
Update docker-compose.yml to use the new configuration structure if needed.

## Benefits After Migration

1. **Improved Error Handling**: Custom error types with proper HTTP status codes
2. **Better Type Safety**: Complete type hints throughout the codebase
3. **Enhanced Performance**: Optimized response formatting and caching
4. **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation and examples
5. **Production Ready**: Robust error handling and monitoring

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, restore from backup:
```bash
cp backup_before_migration/* app/
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Error responses are user-friendly and consistent
- [ ] Performance remains at 0.001s average response time
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] API documentation is accessible at /docs
- [ ] Health checks work properly
- [ ] Background tasks are running
- [ ] Cache operations work correctly
